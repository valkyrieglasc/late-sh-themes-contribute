## 0. Context Maintenance Protocol (LLM-First) [STABLE]

This file is the primary working context for the entire late.sh project.

- LLM agents should treat this as a living document and update it whenever meaningful behavior changes.
- If code and this file diverge, prefer updating this file quickly so future work stays reliable.
- Temporary or branch-specific behavior should be documented here with clear cleanup notes.

### Quick update checklist
- Refresh `Last updated` date
- Review `Current Work` and `Future Work`
- Validate `Critical Invariants`
- Update telemetry references if operation/event names changed
- Remove obsolete notes

### Freshness target
- Re-review this file regularly (every 2 weeks) to prevent context drift.

## 1. Summary [STABLE]

> A cozy terminal clubhouse for developers. Lofi beats, casual games, chat, and tech news - all via SSH.

`ssh late.sh` and you're in. Zero friction, terminal-first, always-on vibes.

The system is a Rust workspace with four crates (`late-cli`, `late-core`, `late-ssh`, `late-web`) backed by PostgreSQL, Icecast audio streaming, and Liquidsoap playlist management.

- **Primary entry points:** SSH server (russh on port 2222), HTTP API (axum on port 4000), Web server (axum on port 3000)
- **Main responsibilities:** Multi-screen TUI over SSH (Dashboard, Chat, The Arcade, Rooms, Artboard), genre voting, paired browser/CLI audio control plus visualizer, real-time chat and chat-adjacent feeds, link/YouTube sharing with AI summaries/ASCII thumbnails, interactive terminal games, persistent game-backed Rooms, and a shared multi-user ASCII Artboard. Detailed CLI behavior lives in `late-cli/CONTEXT.md`; detailed Rooms/Blackjack behavior lives in `late-ssh/src/app/rooms/CONTEXT.md`; detailed Chat behavior lives in `late-ssh/src/app/chat/CONTEXT.md`; detailed Artboard/dartboard behavior lives in `late-ssh/src/app/artboard/CONTEXT.md`. Configurable right-side panels: the global app sidebar (now playing, activity, visualizer, bonsai) plus the arcade lobby leaderboard sidebar, both default-on. Global `q` opens quit confirm; pressing `q` again exits and `Esc` dismisses it.
- **Highest-risk areas:** SSH render loop backpressure, connection limiting, chat sync consistency, paired-client WS routing/state drift

---

## Test Strategy [STABLE]

### Scope and intent

- Cover both runtime apps: `late-ssh` and `late-web`.
- Keep most tests close to code under change (small, deterministic, focused).
- Use integration/smoke tests for boundary behavior across crates/services.

### Strict test boundary rules (required)

**Unit tests (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests` inside `src/` files):**
- MUST be pure logic only: no database, no services, no network, no async runtime required.
- Test input/output transformations, state transitions, parsing, formatting, validation math.
- If you need a `Db`, `Service`, `State`, or any I/O — it is NOT a unit test. Move it to `tests/`.
- Good examples: `rate_limit.rs` (in-memory limiter logic), `state.rs` (enum transitions), `input.rs` (key → action mapping).
- Preferred source layout for a domain is `src/.../<domain>/mod.rs` plus adjacent `state.rs`, `input.rs`, `ui.rs`, `svc.rs` as needed. `mod.rs` files must only contain `pub mod` declarations — never `pub use` re-exports.
- Keep pure unit tests inline in those source files. Do NOT create `src/.../<domain>/tests/` folders just to split unit tests.

**Integration tests (`late-ssh/tests/`, `late-web/tests/`, `late-core/tests/`):**
- MUST use testcontainers for database access — always go through `late_core::test_utils::test_db()` (or the `helpers::new_test_db()` wrapper in `late-ssh`).
- NEVER use `Db::new(&DbConfig::default())` or hardcoded connection strings in integration tests.
- `late-core::test_utils` owns shared test infrastructure: `test_db()`, `create_test_user()`. Use these everywhere instead of rolling per-test user creation — except in `late-core` model tests that are testing `User::create` itself.
- `late-ssh/tests/helpers/mod.rs` re-exports `create_test_user` from `late-core` and adds ssh-specific helpers (`test_config`, `test_app_state`, `make_app`, etc.). Domain test directories access these via `#[path = "../helpers/mod.rs"] mod helpers;` in their `main.rs`.
- Any test that touches DB, services, network, or cross-module orchestration belongs here.
- Preferred integration layout is domain-oriented under crate `tests/`, mirroring the source structure: `tests/<domain>/main.rs` with sibling `svc.rs`, `state.rs`, etc. as needed. `late-core` tests are named after their domain (`user.rs`, `vote.rs`, `chat/`).

**LLM enforcement:**
- On every code change, check: does this need a test? If yes, classify it strictly as unit or integration per the rules above.
- LLM agents must NOT run `cargo test`, `cargo nextest`, or `cargo clippy` in this repo. The human owner runs verification manually because those commands are too blocking in normal agent workflows.
- Do NOT put integration-flavored tests (DB calls, service interactions, spawning tasks) inside `#[cfg(test)]` module blocks in `src/` files.
- Do NOT invent extra source-side test directory structure when inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` is sufficient; reserve directory splits for crate-level integration tests under `tests/`.
- If a test is intentionally deferred (WIP/incomplete dependency), document the gap and cleanup plan in PR/context notes.

### Preferred test pyramid for this repo

1. Unit tests in module files — pure logic only, no I/O (`state.rs`, `input.rs`, `ui.rs`, `rate_limit.rs`).
2. Integration tests in `late-ssh/tests/` and `late-web/tests/` — real DB via testcontainers, shared helpers.
3. Workspace-wide checks before merge (`fmt`, `clippy`, `nextest`).

### Per-app guidance

For `late-ssh`:

- `app/*/state.rs`: unit tests for transition rules, event drains, selection/filter logic (includes profile field navigation).
- `app/*/input.rs`: unit tests for key routing and mode guards.
- `app/*/ui.rs`: unit tests for pure formatting/layout helpers only; avoid brittle pixel snapshots.
- `app/*/{mod,state,input,ui,svc,model}.rs`: keep the domain module flat and predictable; add pure unit tests inline in the relevant file instead of under `src/app/*/tests/`.
- `app/render.rs` / `app/tick.rs`: integration tests for orchestration (needs services/DB → goes in `tests/`).
- `app/*/svc.rs`: integration tests in `tests/<domain>/svc.rs` (needs real DB).
- Integration test directories mirror the source domain structure: `tests/<domain>/main.rs` with split files like `svc.rs`, `state.rs` as needed. Game tests live under `tests/games/<game>.rs`.
- `ssh.rs` / `api.rs`: smoke tests in `tests/ssh_smoke.rs` / `tests/ws_smoke.rs`.

For `late-web`:

- Handler/route behavior in `late-web/tests/*` with request/response assertions.
- Page/model transformations as unit tests under `src/pages/*` (pure logic only).
- Error mapping tests in `src/error.rs` for stable status/body behavior (pure logic only).

### Command policy

- LLM agents must not run tests or lint gates locally. Do not run `cargo test`, `cargo nextest`, or `cargo clippy`; leave all verification to the human owner.
- If code changes would normally merit verification, note the expected command(s) in handoff instead of running them.
- The human owner may still use the full CI-equivalent gate locally:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo nextest run --workspace --all-targets
```

### Known environment caveats

- Some integration/smoke tests require Docker/testcontainers and may fail in restricted sandboxes.
- **Temporary russh crypto dependency caveat:** `russh 0.60.1` is currently the latest crates.io release and fixes the tracked advisory, but its dependency stack pulls `pkcs8 0.11.0-rc.11`, which does not compile against final `pkcs5 0.8.0` because the PBES2 method was renamed. The lockfile pins `pkcs5` to `0.8.0-rc.13`, matching the prerelease API expected by `pkcs8`. Recheck this after the next `russh`/`pkcs8` release and remove the pin once upstream resolves cleanly.
- If a feature area is intentionally WIP, temporary lint/test gaps are acceptable only when explicitly documented and tracked for cleanup.
- **Tool bootstrap:** The repo now includes `.mise.toml` with `rust`, `mold`, and `cargo-nextest`. Prefer `mise install` before local development so the expected toolchain and test runner are available.
- **Cargo environment setup:** For local host development, use Cargo's normal defaults, including the standard repo-local `target/` directory. Docker/dev containers still use `/app/target` via container configuration. `CARGO_HOME=$HOME/.cargo` remains a valid override when an environment needs it, but it is not a repo-wide requirement.
- **`LATE_FORCE_ADMIN=1`** — dev-only escape hatch: OR'd with `users.is_admin` at session init (`late-ssh/src/ssh.rs`), so every SSH session lands as admin. Must stay `0` in prod — enforced by `required_bool` and hardcoded to `"0"` in `infra/service-ssh.tf`.

- `VoteService` (in `app/vote/svc.rs`), `ChatService` (in `app/chat/svc.rs`), `ArticleService` (in `app/chat/news/svc.rs`), and `NotificationService` (in `app/chat/notification_svc.rs`) expose shared `watch` snapshots (`subscribe_state()` / `subscribe_snapshot()`).
- `ProfileService` (in `app/profile/svc.rs`) exposes per-user `watch` snapshots backed by service-owned maps (`subscribe_snapshot(user_id)`).
- `LeaderboardService` exposes a shared `watch::Receiver<Arc<LeaderboardData>>` refreshed from DB every 30s. Contains today's champions, streak leaders, per-user streak map (used for chat badges and profile achievements), all-time high scores (Tetris + 2048), and chip leaders (top balances).
- `ChipService` (in `app/games/chips/svc.rs`) manages the Late Chips economy: `ensure_chips(user_id)` grants the daily 500-chip stipend on login, `grant_daily_bonus_task(user_id, difficulty_key)` awards 50/100/150 chips on daily puzzle completion. All 4 daily game services hold a `ChipService` clone and call it in `record_win_task()`.
- `RoomsService` (in `app/rooms/svc.rs`) owns persistent game-room creation/listing/deletion over `game_rooms` + associated `chat_rooms`, publishes `RoomsSnapshot` via `watch`, and emits `RoomsEvent` success/failure banners.
- `BlackjackTableManager` / `BlackjackService` own process-local per-room Blackjack runtime state. Detailed Rooms/Blackjack contracts live in `late-ssh/src/app/rooms/CONTEXT.md`.
- Events remain `broadcast` for all subscribers; targeted variants carry `user_id` and are filtered in UI state.

### 2.5 TUI Rendering and State Architecture (Sync vs Async Boundary)

To maintain a buttery-smooth 15-60 FPS over SSH, the architecture strictly separates synchronous UI rendering from asynchronous business logic:

1. **The Setup (`ssh.rs` / `main.rs`)**
   When a new SSH client connects, a `SessionConfig` is built containing global *Services* (like `VoteService`, `ArticleService`, which hold DB pools and API keys).
2. **The Initialization (`app/state.rs`)**
   Inside `App::new()`, these services are used to create the *UI States* (e.g., `ChatState` which owns the `news::State` and `notifications::State`). Each UI State stores its `user_id`, subscribes to service channels, and spawns a per-user background refresh task (aborted on `Drop`).
3. **The Sync Loop (`app/tick.rs`)**
   Every 66ms, `App::tick()` runs. It calls `tick()` on all UI states. This:
   - Drains the channels to instantly update local memory state (e.g., `Vec<Article>`). User-targeted events are filtered by `self.user_id`.
4. **The Paint Job (`app/render.rs` -> `ui.rs`)**
   Immediately after the tick, `App::render()` runs. It passes the purely synchronous UI state directly to the draw functions. The UI just reads local memory and draws boxes. No `.await`, no freezing.
5. **The User Action (`app/input.rs`)**
   SSH keystrokes now first land in a per-session unbounded queue owned by the render task (`late-ssh/src/ssh.rs`). Right before each render, the task drains queued bytes into `App::handle_input()`, then runs `tick()` / `render()`. That keeps the input handler off the app mutex entirely for ordinary keystrokes while preserving the same synchronous UI state model. When an action requires I/O (like hitting `Enter` to save), the input handler fires a fire-and-forget method on the Service. The Service spawns a Tokio task to do the DB/API work, pushes the result to the channel, and the UI catches it on the next 66ms tick.

### 2.6 Render loop timing (world tick + input-driven)

Each SSH session spawns **one render task** (`late-ssh/src/ssh.rs`) with two independent trigger sources:

- **World tick** — fires every `WORLD_TICK_INTERVAL` (66ms). Advances animations (`app.tick()`), renders, ships the frame. Floor cadence ≈ 15 FPS regardless of input.
- **Input-driven render** — fires within `MIN_RENDER_GAP` (15ms) of any keystroke or terminal resize. Renders *without* advancing world time, so typed characters echo at near-native latency instead of waiting up to 66ms for the next world tick.

The select loop picks which branch to act on:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    INPUT["data() / window_change_request()<br/>(keystroke, resize)"] -->|"queue keystrokes or apply resize / set dirty=true"| SIGNAL
    SIGNAL["RenderSignal<br/>dirty: AtomicBool<br/>notify: tokio::Notify"] -->|"notify_one()<br/>(after mutex released)"| LOOP
    WT["world_tick.tick()<br/>every 66ms"] --> LOOP
    LOOP{"biased select!"}
    LOOP -->|"world tick fired"| ADVANCE["advance_world=true<br/>render"]
    LOOP -->|"input_pending &&<br/>gap elapsed"| RENDER["advance_world=false<br/>render"]
    LOOP -->|"notify && dirty"| ARM["input_pending=true<br/>loop"]
    LOOP -->|"notify && !dirty"| DROP["eat stale permit<br/>loop"]
    ADVANCE --> CLEAR["clear dirty under mutex,<br/>app.tick() + app.render()"]
    RENDER --> CLEAR
    CLEAR --> LOOP
```

`biased` ordering ensures the world tick wins on ties so animations aren't starved under a keystroke flood. `next_render_action` is extracted as a standalone async fn so the decision logic is unit-testable without a full session.

#### Timing example — typing burst

```
t=0     world tick fires → render, previous_render=0, dirty=false
t=3     keystroke → dirty=true, notify_one (permit stored)
t=3+    select: notify branch → dirty=true → input_pending=true, continue
t=3+    select: sleep_until(0+15ms) armed, notify disabled
t=8     keystroke → dirty=true (already), notify_one (permit stored, branch disabled)
t=15    sleep_until fires → render covers BOTH keystrokes, dirty cleared
t=15+   select: notify branch eats leftover permit → dirty=false → nothing
t=66    world tick → render, animations advance
```

Two keystrokes → one render at t=15. No spurious trailing frame.

#### Why `dirty` is separate from `Notify`

`tokio::sync::Notify::notify_one()` stores **one** permit when no waiter is active. If `Notify` alone gated renders, permits left over from input already batched into an earlier render would fire an identical repeat frame one throttle window later. Two primitives, two jobs:

- `Notify` — alarm clock. Wakes the task.
- `dirty` — sticky note. Source of truth for "there is unrendered state".

The input path now sets `dirty` immediately after enqueueing bytes for the render task, without taking the app mutex. The render task clears `dirty` immediately before draining that queue under the mutex. Invariant: input that lands during a render flips `dirty` back to `true`, so the current frame may miss it, but the next loop iteration must pick it up.

The stored-permit regression is locked down by `ssh::tests::stale_permit_does_not_arm_throttle`; the surrounding tests cover throttle timing, `biased` wins, and the idle/active paths.

#### Scope and constraints

- **Throttle is per-session** — one session's flood can't affect another's cadence.
- **Ceiling: ~67 renders/sec per session** (`1000 / MIN_RENDER_GAP_MS`) — above smoothness threshold, below CPU-DoS territory.
- **Does not address lock contention** — the app mutex is still shared between `data()` and the render task; see §8.5 A. This change only closes the input-to-frame cadence gap, not the lock-held-across-tick stall.

### 2.7 Audio infrastructure

    FETCH -->|"watch channel"| APP["App sidebar"]
    VS["VoteService"] -->|"vibe.set genre"| LS
```

#### Music licensing strategy [VOLATILE]

The audio stack is local-playlist-only. Liquidsoap reads curated local `.m3u` playlists backed by files in `/music`, then streams the result through Icecast. There are no third-party live radio upstreams in the current design.

#### Source priority

Genres now use `mksafe(local_playlist)` only. Each playlist uses `mode="randomize"` + `loop=true` to shuffle all tracks and play through before re-shuffling, with `check_next` guards against back-to-back repeats at loop boundaries.

**Migration status (April 2026):**
- Lofi: **DONE** — 50 tracks, all CC0/CC-BY
- Ambient: **DONE** — 20 curated CC-BY 4.0 tracks
- Classical: **DONE** — 40 curated public-domain Musopen tracks
- Jazz: local-only for now; still the thinnest genre and a likely removal candidate

There are no live upstream radio sources in `radio.liq`.

#### Current local music library [VOLATILE]

Music binaries live in Cloudflare R2 (bucket configured via `MUSIC_BUCKET` GitHub var), synced to the Liquidsoap PVC at `/music/` during infra deploys by the `sync_music` job in `deploy_infra.yml`. Playlists are `.m3u` files in `infra/liquidsoap/` using Liquidsoap `annotate:` format and remain in git.

#### Music library [VOLATILE]

All music is CC0 or CC-BY licensed. CC-BY tracks require attribution — handled automatically via `annotate:` metadata in `.m3u` files flowing through ICY metadata to the sidebar "now playing" display.

Detailed track lists and source URLs live in [`MUSIC.md`](MUSIC.md).

- Lofi: done, 50 tracks, mixed `CC0` and `CC-BY 4.0`
- Ambient: done, 20 curated `CC-BY 4.0` tracks from Amarent, Ketsa, and The Imperfectionist
- Classical: done, 40 curated public-domain tracks from Musopen / Internet Archive
- Jazz: planned, source targets are HoliznaCC0, Kevin MacLeod, and Ketsa

Playlist generation uses curated manifests in `scripts/fetch_cc_music.py`, preserves `duration` in `annotate:` metadata, and can intentionally limit a playlist to the curated set even if older files still exist on disk.

#### Future music sources [VOLATILE]

**High-potential (verified CC0/CC-BY, not yet downloaded):**
- HoliznaCC0: 571 total tracks across ~50+ albums, all CC0. Full discography: https://freemusicarchive.org/music/holiznacc0/discography
- Ketsa: large catalog (lofi, jazz, soul, ambient, downtempo), CC-BY. Album "CC BY: FREE TO USE FOR ANYTHING" has 70 tracks: https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Ketsa/cc-by-free-to-use-for-anything
- John Bartmann: "Public Domain Soundtrack Music: Album One" (CC0) on Bandcamp
- Kevin MacLeod: 359 tracks (CC-BY): https://kevinmacleod.bandcamp.com/album/complete-collection-creative-commons
- FMA public domain search (9,000+ tracks): https://freemusicarchive.org/search?adv=1&music-filter-public-domain=1

**Not selected for the local library:**
- **Pixabay:** custom license, not ideal for a standalone music stream
- **Chad Crouch:** CC BY-NC + commercial licensing split
- **Blue Dot Sessions:** CC BY-NC only
- **Kai Engel:** mixed CC-BY/CC-BY-NC catalog, licensing instability after July 2025
- **Classicals.de:** license terms unclear

#### Music storage [STABLE]

Music binaries live in Cloudflare R2, synced to the Liquidsoap PVC during infra deploys (`sync_music` job in `deploy_infra.yml`). Git is the source of truth for playlists, licenses, and source URLs — not for binaries. ConfigMap changes (playlists, radio.liq, icecast.xml) trigger automatic rollouts via `config_hash` annotations on deployment templates — no explicit restart job needed.

#### Download tooling

- `scripts/fetch_cc_music.py` — Downloads from Bandcamp (via yt-dlp) and Internet Archive (via urllib), generates `.m3u` playlists with ffprobe metadata. Supports `--genre` and `--m3u-only` flags.
- Ambient uses a curated FMA manifest inside `scripts/fetch_cc_music.py` instead of the older broad-source ambient target.
- FMA CDN scrape pattern: FMA pages embed `fileUrl` in HTML as `https://files.freemusicarchive.org/storage-freemusicarchive-org/tracks/{hash}.mp3`. These are direct-downloadable without authentication. Extract with regex on the page source (see `/tmp/fetch_fma_tracks.py` for reference).
- Dependencies: `yt-dlp` (installed via pipx), `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `python3`.

#### Metadata handling

Local playlist files retain full annotated metadata including duration (when present in ID3 tags). The `rewrite_np_metadata` function in `radio.liq` formats "now playing" as `Artist - Title | Duration` for the sidebar. Internet streams provided ICY metadata with no duration; local files may or may not have duration depending on the source.

### 2.8 Nonogram Generation and Runtime Split

Nonograms intentionally use an offline generation pipeline instead of generating puzzles during SSH sessions.

1. **Offline generation (`late-core`)**
   `late-core/src/bin/gen_nonograms.rs` generates puzzle banks by size (`10x10`, `15x15`, `20x20`), applies per-size difficulty profiles (`10x10` easy, `15x15` medium, `20x20` hard), validates every accepted candidate with `number-loom`, regenerates until each pack reaches the requested count, and writes only the final JSON assets (validation scratch files are cleaned up automatically).
2. **Shared schema (`late-core`)**
   `late-core/src/nonogram.rs` owns the portable JSON contract (`NonogramPuzzle`, `NonogramPack`, `NonogramPackIndex`), clue derivation, pack validation, and deterministic daily puzzle selection by date.
3. **Static assets (`late-ssh/assets/nonograms/`)**
   Generated packs live under `late-ssh/assets/nonograms/` with one `index.json` plus one pack file per size (`10x10.json`, `15x15.json`, `20x20.json`).
4. **Runtime loading (`late-ssh`)**
   `late-ssh/src/app/games/nonogram/state.rs` loads packs at server startup. SSH sessions only read the already-generated bank; they do not invoke `number-loom` or generate puzzles on demand.
5. **Daily selection**
   The runtime picks one puzzle per size deterministically from the prebuilt bank using the UTC date and the pack `size_key`. This keeps the "daily" experience stable without storing generator state in Postgres.
6. **Runtime persistence**
   `late-ssh` now persists one `daily` and one `personal` slot per user and `size_key` in `nonogram_games`. `d` restores the date-based daily puzzle for the selected size, `p` restores that size's saved personal board, and `n` regenerates a fresh personal puzzle from the current pack.
7. **Daily completion tracking**
   `late-ssh` also records a binary daily completion fact per user, size, and UTC date in `nonogram_daily_wins`. This is intentionally separate from board state and does not track score or time.

Current invariant:
- `late-ssh` is runtime-only for nonograms: read JSON assets, select a puzzle, render/play it, and persist per-user progress. Generation belongs in `late-core/src/bin/gen_nonograms.rs`, not in the SSH hot path.

### 2.9 Local CLI

`late-cli` builds the `late` companion binary. It launches the SSH TUI, plays the audio stream locally, sends visualizer frames over `/api/ws/pair`, and receives paired mute/volume controls from the TUI.

Root-level contracts:
- `late-cli` is a standalone crate with no `late-core` dependency.
- Browser and CLI share the paired-client WebSocket schema, so the TUI can show client kind plus live mute/volume state.
- Native SSH is the default launcher path. `--ssh-mode old` remains the legacy OpenSSH-through-PTY compatibility path, and `--ssh-mode openssh` is the OpenSSH-managed path for hardware-backed keys.
- Native and OpenSSH modes require server support for the `late-cli-token-v1` SSH exec handshake.
- Detailed CLI architecture, flags/env vars, audio pipeline, installer behavior, SSH modes, and fragile invariants live in `late-cli/CONTEXT.md`.

### 2.10 Artboard (Shared ASCII Canvas) [STABLE]

The Artboard is a shared, persistent, multiplayer ASCII canvas on its own top-level screen (`5`, or cycle with `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`). User-facing docs say `Artboard`; code and upstream crates still use `dartboard` heavily, so search both terms.

Detailed Artboard/dartboard behavior lives in `late-ssh/src/app/artboard/CONTEXT.md`, including lifecycle, `late-ssh/src/dartboard.rs` persistence, provenance, keybindings, archive snapshots, tests, and fragile invariants.

Root-level facts:
- The server owns one in-process `dartboard_local::ServerHandle` for the whole `late-ssh` process.
- The canonical canvas size is `384 x 192`.
- Users connect to the shared board only after opening Artboard; leaving drops that session's `LocalClient` and frees the slot.
- Artboard opens in `view` mode; `i` / `Enter` switches into active edit mode.
- Canvas and provenance are saved together in `artboard_snapshots`; daily/monthly archives are exposed by the read-only web gallery at `/gallery`.
- The gallery reads saved DB snapshots, not live server memory, so `main` can lag active drawing by the persistence interval.

## 4. Core Contracts [STABLE]

### 4.1 Public/API contracts

**SSH API (late-ssh, port 4000):**
- `GET /api/health` - DB health check
- `GET /api/now-playing` → `NowPlayingResponse { current_track, listeners_count, started_at_ts }`
- `GET /api/status` → `StatusResponse { online, message, version }`
- `GET /api/ws/pair?token={token}` - WebSocket upgrade for paired browser/CLI control + viz

**WS payloads (client → server):**
- `{ "event": "heartbeat" }`
- `{ "event": "viz", "position_ms": u64, "bands": [f32; 8], "rms": f32 }`
- `{ "event": "client_state", "client_kind": "browser" | "cli", "ssh_mode"?: "native" | "openssh" | "old", "platform"?: "android" | "linux" | "macos" | "windows", "muted": bool, "volume_percent": u8 }`

**WS payloads (server → client):**
- `{ "event": "toggle_mute" }`
- `{ "event": "volume_up" }`
- `{ "event": "volume_down" }`

**Web routes (late-web, port 3000):**
- `GET /` - Landing page: late.sh branding, `ssh late.sh` CTA (click-to-copy), feature list, now-playing/listeners via htmx
- `GET /{token}` - Audio pairing page: WS connection to terminal session, local audio playback, paired mute/volume control, Web Audio analyzer for TUI visualizer, now-playing via htmx
- `GET /status?pairing={bool}` - htmx fragment: now-playing track + listener count (fetched from SSH API internally). `pairing=false` for landing footer, `pairing=true` for pairing detail view. Polled every 5s.
- `GET /dashboard` - Live metrics page (HTMX, internal/testing)
- `GET /test` - Error simulation endpoint
- All other routes → redirect to `/`

**Service stream contracts (internal):**
- `VoteService::subscribe_state()` (in `app::vote::svc`) → shared `watch::Receiver<VoteSnapshot>` (durable latest state)
- Chat service/news/notifications/showcase stream contracts live in `late-ssh/src/app/chat/CONTEXT.md`.
- `ProfileService::subscribe_snapshot(user_id)` → per-user `watch::Receiver<...Snapshot>` (durable latest state)
- `ProfileService::prune_user_snapshot_channel(user_id)` → explicit cleanup hook called from UI state `Drop`; removes idle per-user snapshot senders
- `LeaderboardService::subscribe()` → `watch::Receiver<Arc<LeaderboardData>>` (shared, refreshed every 30s from DB; contains today's champions, streak leaders, per-user streak map for badge computation)
- `subscribe_events() → broadcast::Receiver<...Event>` - transient events/notices

### 4.2 Auth and scope model

- **Identity:** SSH key fingerprint → `users` table (`User::find_by_fingerprint`)
- **Open access:** `LATE_SSH_OPEN=true` enables auth, but only public-key auth is accepted; password and keyboard-interactive are always rejected
- **User scoping:** Votes are scoped to `user_id` (FK to `users.id`)
- **Chat scoping:** Rooms visible via membership (`ChatRoom::list_for_user`, `ChatRoomMember`)
- **Auto-join:** Public rooms with `auto_join=true` are seeded for a user only when the user record is first created; reconnecting does not re-add rooms the user already left. The regular `/public #room` user command creates/opens an opt-in room only for the caller (`auto_join=false`, no bulk member add). Permanent/admin room creation still bulk-adds all existing users when the room is created/promoted.
- **Multi-tenant isolation:** All user data queries filter by `user_id`; no cross-user reads

### 4.3 Data model and key enums

**Entities (all use UUID v7 PKs, `id`/`created`/`updated` built into `model!` macro, lists default to `ORDER BY created DESC`):**

| Entity | Table | Key constraints |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| User | `users` | `fingerprint` UNIQUE; `is_admin` and `is_moderator` role flags; `username` trimmed length 1-32, case-insensitive UNIQUE via `idx_users_username_lower`, format `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$` and no `@` (canonical public handle); `settings` JSONB holds `ignored_user_ids: [uuid]` (keyed by id, not username, so renames don't drop ignores), `theme_id` (string), `enable_background_color` (bool), `show_right_sidebar` (bool, default-on when absent), `show_games_sidebar` (bool, default-on when absent), `notify_kinds: [text]` (desktop-notification opt-ins: `dms`, `mentions`, `game_events`), `notify_cooldown_mins` (int ≥ 0; 0 = no throttle) |
| Vote | `votes` | `user_id` UNIQUE (one vote per user per round) |
| ChatRoom | `chat_rooms` | `kind` IN (general, language, dm, topic), complex constraints |
| ChatRoomMember | `chat_room_members` | PK `(room_id, user_id)`, `last_read_at` |
| ChatMessage | `chat_messages` | `body` 1-2000 chars, nullable `reply_to_message_id` self-FK for reply jumps |
| Article | `articles` | `url` UNIQUE, `user_id` FK |
| ArticleFeedRead | `article_feed_reads` | `user_id` PK/FK, per-user news read checkpoint |
| Notification | `notifications` | `user_id`+`actor_id` FK to users, `message_id` FK to chat_messages, `room_id` FK to chat_rooms, `read_at` nullable, CHECK(user_id<>actor_id) |
| SudokuDailyWin | `sudoku_daily_wins` | `UNIQUE(user_id, difficulty_key, puzzle_date)`, score tracked |
| NonogramDailyWin | `nonogram_daily_wins` | `UNIQUE(user_id, size_key, puzzle_date)`, binary completion |
| MinesweeperGame | `minesweeper_games` | `UNIQUE(user_id, difficulty_key, mode)`, stores seeded mine_map + player_grid + lives (3-life system) |
| MinesweeperDailyWin | `minesweeper_daily_wins` | `UNIQUE(user_id, difficulty_key, puzzle_date)`, best score (lives remaining) retained |
| SolitaireGame | `solitaire_games` | `UNIQUE(user_id, difficulty_key, mode)`, stores seeded stock/waste/foundations/tableau |
| SolitaireDailyWin | `solitaire_daily_wins` | `UNIQUE(user_id, difficulty_key, puzzle_date)`, best score retained |
| BonsaiTree | `bonsai_trees` | `user_id` UNIQUE, growth_points, last_watered DATE, seed BIGINT, is_alive BOOLEAN |
| BonsaiGrave | `bonsai_graveyard` | `user_id` FK (not unique — multiple deaths), survived_days, died_at |
| BonsaiDailyCare | `bonsai_daily_care` | `UNIQUE(user_id, care_date)`, UTC daily care row with watered flag, generated branch goal, cut branch ids, and one-shot water/prune penalty flags |
| UserChips | `user_chips` | `user_id` PK/FK, `balance` BIGINT (floor=100), `last_stipend_date` DATE |
| Showcase | `showcases` | `user_id` FK; `title` 1-120, `url` 1-2000, `description` 1-800, `tags` TEXT[] (lowercased, ≤8). Listed newest-first, edit/delete restricted to author or admin |
| ShowcaseFeedRead | `showcase_feed_reads` | `user_id` PK/FK, `last_read_at` timestamp cursor for per-user Showcase unread counts |
| GameRoom | `game_rooms` | Generic game-room registry. `id` UUIDv7, `chat_room_id` UNIQUE FK to `chat_rooms`, `game_kind` TEXT, `slug` UNIQUE, `display_name` non-empty, `status` IN (`open`, `in_round`, `paused`, `closed`), `settings` JSONB, optional `created_by`. `GameKind` is a Rust enum over text, not a Postgres enum. |
| ArtboardSnapshot | `artboard_snapshots` | `board_key` UNIQUE (`main`, `daily:YYYY-MM-DD`, `monthly:YYYY-MM`), `canvas` JSONB, `provenance` JSONB. Runtime contracts live in `late-ssh/src/app/artboard/CONTEXT.md`. |

**Key enums:**
- `Genre`: `Lofi`, `Classic`, `Ambient`, `Jazz` (vote/service/liquidsoap)
- `Screen`: `Dashboard`, `Chat`, `Games`, `Rooms`, `Artboard` (cycle: `Dashboard -> Chat -> Games -> Rooms -> Artboard -> Dashboard`; News, Mentions, Discover, and Showcase are synthetic room-like entries within Chat, not separate screens. News, Mentions, and Showcase each carry persisted unread state; Showcase is a user-authored project showcase backed by the `showcases` table.)
- `ChatRoom.kind`: `general` (slug=general), `language` (slug=lang-{code}), `topic` (user/admin created), `dm` (canonical user pair), `game` (Rooms-backed embedded chat)
- `ChatRoom.visibility`: `public`, `private`, `dm`
- `GameKind`: Rust enum in `late-core::models::game_room`; currently `Blackjack`. Persisted as `TEXT` in Postgres to keep future game-kind changes/migrations simple.

### 4.4 Error model

- **Service errors:** Propagated via `anyhow::Result`, surfaced as `VoteEvent` / `ChatEvent` error variants
- **Chat:** `SendSucceeded` / `SendFailed` with `request_id` for composer feedback
- **Votes:** `VoteEvent::Error { user_id, message }` for unknown user
- **SSH:** Connection rejected on limit exceeded; render frame drops logged
- **Web:** `AppError::Internal` / `AppError::Render` → HTTP 500 with template fallback

---

## 5. Telemetry and Observability [STABLE]

- **Architecture:** 100% native OpenTelemetry (OTLP) pipeline powered by `opentelemetry` and `tracing` crates, routed through an OpenTelemetry Collector into a pure VictoriaMetrics backend.
- **Traces (`VictoriaTraces`):** Distributed tracing spans generated via `#[tracing::instrument]`. The Collector automatically generates RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration) from these spans using the `spanmetrics` connector.
- **Service graph requirement:** VictoriaTraces must run with `--servicegraph.enableTask=true` for the Grafana service graph / dependencies view to populate from trace relationships.
- **Logs (`VictoriaLogs`):** Structured JSON logs bypassing stdout completely via `opentelemetry-appender-tracing`. Trace IDs and Span IDs are natively embedded for full cross-correlation in Grafana.
- **Metrics (`VictoriaMetrics`):** Custom metrics (e.g., counters) pushed directly via OTLP PeriodicReader, alongside the RED metrics generated by the Collector.
- **HTTP server spans:** `late-web` wraps the router with request middleware that emits `otel.kind=server` spans and records `http.request.method`, `http.route`, `url.path`, and `http.response.status_code`; 5xx responses set `otel.status_code=ERROR`.
- **Trace propagation:** `late-core::telemetry::init_telemetry()` installs the W3C Trace Context propagator. `late-web` injects trace headers on outbound `/api/now-playing` requests, and `late-ssh` extracts incoming headers on API requests so cross-service traces can form real parent/child relationships.
- **Dashboard playground metric:** The interactive dashboard counter posts to `/dashboard/counter`, which emits `dashboard_counter_actions_total{action=...}` for Grafana testing.
- **Grafana provisioning invariant:** The metrics datasource uses the stable UID `victoriametrics`; provisioned dashboards must reference that UID instead of Grafana-generated datasource IDs.
- **Console Output:** Local dev uses `tracing_subscriber::fmt` with `RUST_LOG=info,late_web=debug,late_ssh=debug,late_core=debug`.
- **DB health:** `GET /api/health` endpoint, `Db::health()` method
- **Connection counts:** Per-IP tracking in `State.conn_counts`, global via semaphore. When `LATE_SSH_PROXY_PROTOCOL=true`, SSH per-IP limits use the client IP from PROXY protocol.
- **Presence/listener count source:** TUI sidebar online/users and `/api/now-playing.listeners_count` both use `State.active_users`.

---

## 6. Current Work [VOLATILE]

In progress:
- **Rooms/Blackjack:** Active multiplayer table-game work is documented in `late-ssh/src/app/rooms/CONTEXT.md`. Root context keeps only project-wide contracts; local context owns directory, service, Blackjack runtime, rendering, dashboard slot, and known-gap details.

Future:
- **Nonograms (v2)**: Replace random generation with pixel-art-to-nonogram pipeline or bulk-curate from webpbn.com.
---

## 7. Future Work & Roadmap [VOLATILE]

1. Chat upgrades: better backlog pagination, moderation polish, and richer matchmaking hooks

Known gaps/risks:
- Online/listener metrics are app-level presence (`active_users`, includes @bot and @graybeard), not true Icecast listener analytics
- Time remaining is approximate (up to 5s polling delay on track change)
- No external metrics or alerting system
- **Single-replica assumption:** Several structures are purely in-memory and not shared across processes (see multi-replica notes below)
- **SSH ingress reload risk:** `ssh late.sh` currently reaches `late-ssh` through RKE2 ingress-nginx TCP passthrough (`infra/ssh-tcp.tf`, port `22 -> service-ssh-sv:2222::PROXY`). Long-lived SSH sessions can be dropped after any ingress-nginx config reload because old workers are terminated after `worker_shutdown_timeout` (observed 2026-04-29 after cert-manager renewed `service-web-tls`: reload at `19:56:37Z`, mass SSH/WS disconnect at `20:00:38Z`, matching the 240s timeout). Future infra improvement: stop routing SSH through ingress-nginx; use a dedicated TCP LoadBalancer/NodePort/host proxy for SSH so HTTP/TLS reloads cannot kill SSH sessions. Short-term mitigation: increase ingress-nginx `worker-shutdown-timeout`, but that only delays the disconnect.
- **IPv6 ingress status:** RKE2/CNI `hostPort` exposes the current ingress-nginx path for IPv4 only; do not switch the main ingress controller to `hostNetwork` without a rollout plan. Public IPv6 is handled by the separate `kube-system/ipv6-proxy` HAProxy DaemonSet in `infra/ipv6-proxy.tf`, binding `2a01:4f9:c013:2ae1::1` on `80`, `443`, and `22`; HTTP(S) forwards to localhost ingress hostPorts, while SSH forwards to `service-ssh-sv:2222` with PROXY protocol. Verified working externally on 2026-05-03; `Network is unreachable` during `ssh -6 late.sh` means the client lacks IPv6 egress.
- **Stateful VT parsing in `late-ssh/src/app/input.rs`:** SSH input now runs through a persistent `vte::Parser`, so CSI/SS3 sequences and bracketed paste survive split russh reads instead of assuming the whole escape sequence lands in one chunk. That removes the old split-paste failure where `[200~` / `[201~` residue or embedded newlines could leak through as live keystrokes. The app still keeps two pragmatic layers on top: `is_likely_paste` heuristically treats large printable unmarked chunks as paste for terminals without bracketed paste, and `sanitize_paste_markers`/`strip_paste_markers` still scrub stored residue defensively when copying URLs from older polluted state. Standalone `Esc` is resolved on a short tick delay so split escape sequences are not mistaken for cancel keys.

Roadmap ideas:
1. Nail one addictive loop: join -> listen -> chat -> vote -> return tomorrow.
2. Pick a clear ICP first: solo devs at night vs remote teams during work hours.
3. ~~Add one "reason to come back" mechanic~~ ✓ Daily streaks + badge tiers + leaderboard. Next: daily room rituals, timed events.
4. Keep friction near zero: ssh late.sh + optional browser pairing only when wanted.
5. Measure retention early: D1/D7 return, session length, messages/user, votes/session.

### The Arcade Pipeline [VOLATILE]

**Shipped:**
- ~~Tetris (Ascii Drop)~~ ✓ Endless falling-block arcade, 15fps gravity, persisted runs, per-user high scores.
- ~~Minesweeper~~ ✓ Classic logic puzzle with daily seeded boards and personal infinite play.
- ~~2048~~ ✓ ~~Sudoku~~ ✓ ~~Nonograms~~ ✓ ~~Solitaire~~ ✓

**Table Games (active buildout):**
- **Blackjack:** Persistent rooms, per-room runtime services, embedded room chat, and chip settlement are live in the Rooms screen. Detailed runtime behavior lives in `late-ssh/src/app/rooms/CONTEXT.md`. Still missing AFK/disconnect handling.
- **Texas Hold'em Poker (PvP):** The ultimate late-night clubhouse game. Table-scoped chat, robust turn state.

**Async 1v1:**
- **Chess:** Correspondence style — make moves at your own pace over hours/days.
- **Battleship:** Fire a shot and check back tomorrow.

**Real-time Multiplayer:**
- **Tron (Lightbikes):** 15fps grid-based survival arena.

**Card Games:**
- **Cribbage / Bridge / Thousand (Tysiąc):** Cozy trick-taking games, deep strategy.

### Monthly chip leaderboard resets
- Archive monthly chip leaders (top 3 get a permanent badge?)
- Reset balances to baseline at month end
- "Hall of Fame" display somewhere

### Strategy multiplayer (Chess, Battleship)
- No chips needed — W/L record + rating
- Async: make a move, come back later
- Game completion counts toward daily streaks
- `/challenge @user chess` in chat for matchmaking

### More casino games (Poker)
- Texas Hold'em: PvP, uses chip betting
- Needs turn management, pot logic, hand evaluation
- Higher complexity — build after Blackjack validates the chip system

### Chat-based matchmaking
- Activity feed broadcast when someone sits at an empty table
- `/play <game>` and `/challenge @user <game>` commands
- Accept/decline prompts

---

## Game category model (unified view)

| Category | Games | Win condition | Leaderboard section | Streaks | Chips |
|----------|-------|--------------|-------------------|---------|-------|
| Daily puzzles | Sudoku, Nonograms, Minesweeper, Solitaire | Solve the daily | Today's Champions | Yes | +50 bonus per completion |
| High-score | Tetris, 2048 | Personal best | All-Time High Scores | No | No |
| Casino | Blackjack, Poker (future) | Grow your chip balance | Chip Leaders | Optional | Bet and win/lose |
| Strategy | Chess, Battleship (future) | Beat opponent | W/L + Rating | Yes (game completed) | No |

### Persistent Multiplayer World (Big Bet) [VOLATILE]

An always-running game where every connected SSH session is automatically a participant. The world ticks forward whether you're watching or not — drop in, make moves, drop out, come back tomorrow.

**Direction:** 4X / trading / economy game. Think simplified space traders or terminal-scale Civilization — explore, expand, exploit, trade. Every connected user is a player in the same persistent world.

**Why it fits late.sh:**
- Always-on matches the clubhouse vibe — the world is alive when you SSH in
- Scales naturally with player count (more players = richer economy/politics)
- Gives a strong "check back tomorrow" retention loop
- Integrates with Late Chips economy
- Chat becomes strategic (alliances, trade negotiation, trash talk)

**Open design questions:**
- Turn-based (ticks every N minutes) vs real-time with rate-limited actions?
- How much can happen while you're offline? (auto-trade, passive income, vulnerability to raids?)
- Map topology: shared grid, star map, abstract network?
- Win conditions or endless sandbox?

### Bonsai Tree Enhancements
- Seasonal color shifts (real-world date), profile display for visitors, graveyard rendering on profile.
- Fancier renderer — possibly port/adapt `cbonsai` (https://github.com/mhzawadi/homebrew-cbonsai) for richer growth animation and branching.

### GitHub Notifications Widget
- Read-only dashboard widget showing PR reviews, mentions, issue updates via PAT.
- Gives solo devs a productivity reason to keep the terminal open.

### Other Ideas
- Daily/weekly rituals (lo-fi standup, shipped rollup, weekend recap)
- Ambient presence (quiet hours, listening since, typing indicator)
- Micro-collab tools (shared scratchpad, snippet paste, pairing ping)
- Cozy utilities (pomodoro, focus playlists, now-playing shoutouts)
- Community texture (rotating shoutout board, wall of thanks)
- Events (coffee breaks, AMAs, mini coding jams)
- Personalization (accent color, favorite vibe, custom tagline)

### Chat implementation

Chat-specific refresh/tail loading, commands, rendering, keybindings, synthetic entries, performance notes, and gotchas live in `late-ssh/src/app/chat/CONTEXT.md`.

### Multi-replica readiness (future)

Currently the SSH app assumes a single process. These in-memory structures would need to be externalized (Redis / Postgres) for multiple replicas:

| Structure | Location | Current | To externalize |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| `current_genre` / `round_id` | `VoteService::ServiceState` | In-memory, resets to Lofi on restart | Persist to DB; only one replica runs the switch timer (leader election or DB lock). During pod drain today, the old pod cancels the vote loop immediately so only the new pod keeps mutating rounds/Liquidsoap. |
| `active_users` / `conn_counts` | `State` | In-memory counters | Shared store (Redis or DB) |
| `SessionRegistry` | `session.rs` | In-memory `token → mpsc` | Stays local — sticky sessions route SSH + WS to same replica |
| Vote/Chat/Article events + snapshots, Profile per-user snapshots | `broadcast` / `watch` channels | In-process only | Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY` or Redis pub/sub for cross-replica fan-out |
| @bot + @graybeard chat | `GhostService` | Always-on presence + AI chat tasks; both are dedicated DB users with fixed fingerprints | Single-leader to avoid duplicate chat responses. During pod drain today, the old pod cancels bot tasks immediately. |
| Leaderboard data | `LeaderboardService` | DB-backed `watch` channel, 30s refresh | Already DB-backed; each replica runs its own refresh loop — duplicate work but no write conflict |

**Approach:** Sticky sessions (LB routes by source IP) so each SSH connection lives on one replica. Shared data via DB/Redis. Not needed yet — single replica handles thousands of concurrent SSH sessions.

## 8. Critical Invariants and Tricky Flows [STABLE]

### 8.1 Security/scoping invariants

- All user-data queries MUST filter by `user_id` - enforced by `user_scoped_model!` macro and explicit `_by_user` method variants
- `model!` macro hardcodes `id: Uuid`, `created: DateTime<Utc>`, `updated: DateTime<Utc>` — do NOT duplicate these in `@generated`; use `@generated` only for extra fields (e.g., `last_seen` on User)
- Chat room visibility enforced via `ChatRoom::list_for_user` (membership join) - never expose rooms user hasn't joined
- `#announcements` is read-joinable like other permanent public rooms, but only admins may post there; enforce this in the chat service send path, not only in the UI
- DM rooms canonicalize user IDs (`dm_user_a < dm_user_b` text order) to prevent duplicate DM pairs
- DM room endpoints (`dm_user_a`, `dm_user_b`) are durable even when `chat_room_members` changes: if one participant leaves a DM, the next message from the other participant re-adds both endpoints before targeted delivery. Private topic rooms do not have durable endpoints and still require explicit invites/rejoins.
- `users.username` is the canonical public handle for chat/DM lookup; SSH login seeds it from the SSH username via `User::next_available_username` (sanitizes to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, adds `-N` suffixes to stay unique on `LOWER(username)`)
- @bot and @graybeard bootstrap on app startup: ensure DB user with a fixed `username`, join public rooms, and insert into `active_users` (always online). Both are dedicated users with fixed fingerprints (`bot-fp-000`, `graybeard-fp-000`)
- Connection limits (global semaphore + per-IP counter) plus SSH attempt rate limit (sliding window) MUST be enforced before any auth (effective client IP is resolved from PROXY protocol when enabled)
- Chat message deletes are hard deletes; any moderation/delete path must remove rows directly rather than relying on tombstones

### 8.2 Data integrity invariants

- UUID v7 PKs (`uuidv7()` default) for time-ordered IDs across all tables
- All foreign keys use `ON DELETE CASCADE` - deleting a user cascades to all their data
- Vote table has `UNIQUE(user_id)` - one vote per user, upsert on conflict
- Chat room constraints: general must have `slug='general'`, language must have `language_code`, DM must have both user IDs with correct ordering
- `auto_join` can only be `true` for public rooms

### 8.3 High-risk end-to-end flows

**Paired client control + visualizer:**
1. Trigger: SSH PTY request creates a session token plus the inbound `SessionRegistry` route.
2. Processing: Browser or CLI connects `GET /api/ws/pair?token=...`; API registers an outbound paired-client sender/state slot in `PairedClientRegistry`.
3. Side effects: Paired client sends viz frames (66ms-ish) plus `client_state`; viz frames route through `SessionRegistry` to `App.tick()`, while `client_state` updates paired kind/mute/volume metadata in `PairedClientRegistry`.
4. Side effects: TUI `m`, `+`, and `-` send `toggle_mute`, `volume_up`, and `volume_down` back over the same WS to only the paired client for that token.
5. Failure: If the paired client disconnects, visualizer decays (rms * 0.96 per tick) and paired state disappears. If SSH disconnects, the session token unregisters on drop.

**Chat flows:**
Chat send/edit/delete, ignore, roster/help overlays, replies, dashboard favorites, autocomplete, synthetic entries, and chat rendering flows live in `late-ssh/src/app/chat/CONTEXT.md`.

**Vote round switch:**
1. Trigger: VoteService background tick (5s) detects switch interval (default 60 min) elapsed since last switch
2. Processing: `switch_to_winner()` → pick genre with most votes (or keep current) → clear all votes → increment `round_id` → send `vibe.set <genre>` to Liquidsoap
3. Side effects: All clients detect `round_id` change → clear `my_vote`. Liquidsoap switches playlist.
4. Failure: Liquidsoap TCP failure logged but round still switches locally.

### 8.4 Easy-to-break gotchas

- **Rooms/Blackjack invariants live locally:** directory filters/placeholders, Blackjack render tiers, service-owned stake chips, seat player hydration, dashboard Blackjack slots, and active-room chat routing are documented in `late-ssh/src/app/rooms/CONTEXT.md`.
- **Chat invariants live locally:** room ordering, composer targets, replies, reactions, pins, ignores, snapshots/tails, row caches, synthetic entries, and chat keybindings are documented in `late-ssh/src/app/chat/CONTEXT.md`.
- **Artboard invariants live locally:** dartboard lifecycle, persistence/archives, provenance, active-vs-view input routing, swatches, glyph picker, and gallery lag caveats are documented in `late-ssh/src/app/artboard/CONTEXT.md`.
- **Render loop missed ticks:** 66ms interval with `MissedTickBehavior::Skip` - if a frame takes too long, next ticks are skipped rather than queued (prevents snowball lag)
- **SSH data timeout:** `handle.data` has 50ms timeout to avoid blocking render loop on backpressure
- **SSH send failure is terminal for render task:** if `handle.data` returns `Err` (closed/broken channel), `render_once` now returns an error so the render loop stops and closes channel once, instead of logging warnings every 66ms forever
- **All services are singletons** shared across SSH sessions. `ProfileService` snapshots are per-user channels keyed by `user_id`; events still require `user_id` filtering in UI state. Profile snapshots include the `Profile` projection plus a read-only `bonsai_trees` row when one exists, so viewing a profile can render bonsai without creating/mutating another user's tree. Per-user background refresh tasks are spawned on session init and aborted on `Drop`, and profile snapshot channels are pruned when receivers go away.
- **Web Audio `createMediaElementSource` is one-shot:** Can only be called once per `<audio>` element. AudioContext + source node must be created once and reused across play/pause cycles. Disconnect suspends the context (`audioCtx.suspend()`), replay resumes it — never close and recreate.
- **Browser audio pairing status must not be stomped by WS:** WS `onclose`/`onerror` must check `status !== 'playing'` before setting `'disconnected'`, otherwise a WS drop kills the "streaming" UI while audio is still playing fine
- **Paired-client control routing is latest-wins per token:** `PairedClientRegistry` stores one outbound sender/state entry per session token. If multiple browser/CLI clients pair against the same token, the most recent registration owns control/state until it disconnects.
- **Web/CLI Audio and WS Resiliency:** Both paired clients use bounded retry loops for WebSocket disconnections and audio stream failures. Web Audio reconstructs elements with cache-busting `?t=` URLs, and CLI stream/audio specifics live in `late-cli/CONTEXT.md`.
- **Browser and CLI viz payloads share schema, not implementation:** Both paired clients send `{ event: "viz", position_ms, bands, rms }`, but the browser uses Web Audio `AnalyserNode` while the CLI uses an in-process Rust FFT over playback samples. Expect similar behavior, not identical numbers.
- **CLI invariants live locally:** SSH modes, token handshakes, identity generation, local audio pipeline, terminal resize forwarding, and pre-token input gating are documented in `late-cli/CONTEXT.md`.
- **Activity feed broadcast timing:** `broadcast::Receiver` only sees messages sent AFTER subscription. The receiver must be created in `auth_publickey` (before login event is sent), stored on `ClientHandler`, then `.take()`'d into `SessionConfig` in `pty_request`. Creating the receiver later misses the user's own login event.
- **Leaderboard refresh is async, badges are eventually consistent:** `LeaderboardService` refreshes every 30s. A new daily win won't appear in the leaderboard or chat badges until the next refresh cycle. Activity feed callouts are immediate (fire-and-forget from `record_win_task`).
- **Streak SQL uses gaps-and-islands:** A streak is "current" if its last day is today or yesterday. This means a user who hasn't played today still keeps their streak visible until midnight UTC tomorrow. The `UNION` across `sudoku_daily_wins` and `nonogram_daily_wins` deduplicates dates so playing both games on the same day counts as one streak day.
- **Game services hold `activity_feed` sender:** `SudokuService` and `NonogramService` both hold a clone of the `broadcast::Sender<ActivityEvent>` for win callouts. The username is looked up from `users` inside the fire-and-forget task (via `late_core::models::profile::fetch_username`), not passed from the caller.
- **Bonsai death check runs on login:** `BonsaiService::ensure_tree()` checks `last_watered` against UTC today on every SSH session start. If 7+ days have passed, the tree is killed and a graveyard record is created. This means death is only detected when the user reconnects, not while offline.
- **Bonsai daily care is UTC-based:** session startup ensures today's `bonsai_daily_care` row and applies unapplied penalties from prior care rows once. Missing water does not directly reduce growth, but 7+ dry days kills the tree. Missing the generated daily wrong-branch cuts costs 10 growth. The global `w` opens the care modal; watering now happens inside that modal.
- **Bonsai passive growth is per-session:** The tick counter in `BonsaiState` grants 1 growth point every ~9000 ticks (~10 min at 15fps). If a user has multiple sessions, each grants growth independently. This is acceptable — it rewards being connected, not gaming the system.
- **Bonsai chat glyph is current-user only:** The bonsai stage glyph is only shown next to the current user's own messages: Seed `·`, Sprout `⚘`, Sapling `🌱`, Young `🌲`, Mature `🌳`, Ancient `🌸`, Blossom `🌼`; Dead renders no glyph. Other users' bonsai stages are not queried or displayed in chat (would require a new cross-user lookup).
- **Bonsai growth stages:** living stages use a simple 100-point ladder capped at 700 growth points: Seed 0-99, Sprout 100-199, Sapling 200-299, Young 300-399, Mature 400-499, Ancient 500-599, Blossom 600-700.
- **Bonsai care modal owns pruning:** global `w` opens the care modal (`w care` is rendered on the Bonsai sidebar border). Inside the modal, `w` waters/replants, `p` hard-prunes the whole tree (-100 growth, rerolls seed, resets today's wrong-branch cuts), `hjkl`/arrows move a spatial pruning cursor, `x` cuts only when the cursor is on a generated wrong branch, `s` copies the ASCII snippet, and `?` opens the Bonsai help section. A wrong cut costs -10 growth immediately. Completing all daily wrong-branch cuts preserves the current shape; it no longer rerolls seed.
- **Bonsai seed math is stable, order-sensitive:** `seed % style_count` picks the Japanese style, `(seed / style_count) % shape_count` picks the hand-tuned silhouette within that style, `(seed / (style_count * shape_count)) % 3` picks the texture form (default / airy / dense). Reordering match arms in `tree_ascii` or inserting a new style mid-list silently remaps every existing user's tree to a different silhouette. Append new styles at the end and bump the stage's `high_stage_style_count` / `high_stage_shape_count`.
- **Bonsai music sway works in tight cards:** `render_tree_art_lines()` applies beat-driven horizontal sway through a small viewport helper, so the 24-column right sidebar can crop shifted canopy lines instead of clamping the motion away. The care modal and sidebar share this renderer.
- **Help modal (`?`) intercepts all input:** When `show_help` is true, the input handler dismisses the modal on any keypress before any other input processing. This includes `?` itself (toggle off) and `Esc`.
- **Desktop notifications bypass the frame diff:** OSC 777 (kitty/Ghostty/rxvt-unicode/foot/wezterm/konsole/mlterm) and OSC 9 (iTerm2) payloads are written to `App::pending_terminal_commands`, not into the ratatui frame. `late-ssh::ssh::render_once` drains that buffer **after** pushing the frame diff and sends each payload as a separate `handle.data` call. Writing them inline with `write!(self.shared, …)` would slip them into the diff and get re-emitted on every redraw. Same rule applies to OSC 52 clipboard copies. The session emits an XTVERSION probe (`CSI > q`) alongside the other alt-screen setup bytes and narrows `App::notification_mode` (`Both` → `Osc777` | `Osc9`) from the DCS reply (`ESC P > | <name>(<version>) ST`) — kitty/wezterm/ghostty/foot/konsole/rxvt-unicode/mlterm land on `Osc777`, iTerm2 on `Osc9`, and unknown/non-responding terminals stay on `Both` (prior behavior). Replies are spliced out of the raw byte stream **before** the splash short-circuit so the leading `ESC` doesn't dismiss the splash (`input::extract_xtversion_replies`); the `vte::Parser` DCS path (`hook`/`put`/`unhook`) catches the same reply again after splash and `App::set_terminal_version` is idempotent, so the double-path is intentional.
- **Notification pipeline is kind-tagged and throttled server-side:** `ChatState::pending_notifications` holds `PendingNotification { kind: &'static str, title, body }` entries drained each render. `render.rs` picks the first pending whose `kind` is in `users.settings.notify_kinds` and honors the shared `notify_cooldown_mins` via `App::last_notify_at`. Adding a new kind means: (1) add a matching toggle row in the settings modal UI/state, (2) enqueue it from the relevant event handler, and (3) update the render-side matcher/tests that assume the current `"dms" | "mentions" | "game_events"` set. No tmux DCS wrapping — tmux is explicitly unsupported.
- **Profile notifications default to all-off:** Migration 026 merges profile fields into `users.settings` with `notify_kinds = []` and `notify_cooldown_mins = 0`. `render.rs` only fires if the kind string is present in the user's array, so a brand-new account is silent until they opt in through the settings modal. A focus-tracking `"unfocused"` policy used to exist (DEC mode 1004) but was removed — `notify_kinds` is the whole model now.
- **`Profile` is a view, not a table:** Migration 026 dropped the `profiles` table — username + notify settings + theme now live on `users` (column + `settings` JSONB). `late_core::models::profile::Profile` is a projection loaded via `Profile::load(client, user_id)` and saved via `Profile::update(client, user_id, params)`, which merges into `settings` with `settings || jsonb_build_object(...)` to preserve unrelated keys (theme_id, ignored_user_ids) under concurrent writes. Profile also exposes JSON-backed system fields (`ide`, `terminal`, `os`) plus language tags (`langs`, normalized to up to eight `#tag` values) and `users.created` as `created_at`; the read-only profile modal renders right-side `bonsa` and `late.fetch` boxes when the modal is wide enough.

## 8.5 Input Lag Investigation (~60 concurrent users) [VOLATILE]

Repo-level finding: input now lands in a per-session queue and the render loop wakes on input, so ordinary keystrokes no longer wait on the app mutex before being queued. Remaining broad risk is render cost under high fan-out because `render_once` still holds the app lock across synchronous `app.tick()` + `app.render()`.

Chat-specific row-cache, snapshot, unread-count, and scoped-loading performance notes live in `late-ssh/src/app/chat/CONTEXT.md`.

## 10. Runbook [VOLATILE]

### 10.1 Local development

```bash
# Start full dev stack
docker compose up -d

# Or run services individually:
# Postgres + Icecast + Liquidsoap via docker, Rust services via cargo
docker compose up -d postgres icecast liquidsoap
cargo run -p late-ssh   # Needs LATE_* env vars
cargo run -p late-web   # Needs LATE_WEB_* env vars
```

### 10.2 Database

```bash
# Quick connectivity check
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres -c "select 1;"

# Seed data
sh scripts/seed_chat_rooms.sh
sh scripts/seed_chat_messages.sh
sh scripts/seed_notes.sh

```

### 10.2.1 Production DB access

Production Postgres runs as a CloudNativePG cluster in Kubernetes.

Keep this public doc generic: discover the current service name, secret name, DB name, and DB user from the live cluster or Terraform instead of hardcoding them here.

Fastest working path is to run `psql` from inside a Postgres pod and connect over TCP to the read-write service using credentials from the generated CNPG secret.

```bash
# 1. Find a Postgres pod
kubectl get pods -n default

# 2. Inspect the app deployment / infra to discover:
#    - read-write DB service host
#    - secret name holding DB credentials
#    - secret keys for user/password/dbname

# 3. Decode generated credentials from the discovered secret
kubectl get secret -n default <db-secret> -o jsonpath='{.data.user}' | base64 -d; echo
kubectl get secret -n default <db-secret> -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d; echo
kubectl get secret -n default <db-secret> -o jsonpath='{.data.dbname}' | base64 -d; echo

# 4. Run a query from inside the pod (replace placeholders)
kubectl exec -n default <postgres-pod> -- \
  env PGPASSWORD='<password>' \
  psql -h <rw-service> -U <db-user> -d <db-name> -c "select 1;"
```

Notes:

- Do not use `psql -U <db-user>` over the pod-local socket without `-h <rw-service>`; peer auth inside the container can fail even when TCP auth works.
- For ad hoc prod inspection, prefer read-only `SELECT` queries.
- If the obvious pod name is unavailable, use any live CNPG Postgres pod.

### 10.3 Testing

```bash
# Human-only verification commands. LLM agents should not run these.
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo nextest run --workspace --all-targets
```

Use narrower crate-specific `cargo test` / `cargo nextest run` commands ad hoc while iterating, but keep the workspace gate above as the canonical repo-level check.

### 10.4 Debugging checklist

1. SSH won't connect → Check `LATE_SSH_OPEN`, connection limits/rate limits, SSH key path
2. No audio → Check Icecast container, Liquidsoap container, `LATE_AUDIO_URL`. If streams are down, verify fallback music exists on the PVC (see below)
3. Visualizer not updating → Check browser WS connection, token mismatch, SessionRegistry
4. Votes not switching → Check Liquidsoap telnet reachability (`LATE_LIQUIDSOAP_ADDR`), background tick running
5. Chat not syncing → Check DB connectivity, 10s refresh cadence, snapshot/event channels
6. Now-playing shows "Unknown" → Check Icecast `/status-json.xsl`, metadata format: `"Artist - Title | Duration"` (duration is absent for internet streams — this is expected)
7. Liquidsoap debugging → `docker run --rm savonet/liquidsoap:v2.4.0 liquidsoap -h <topic>`
8. Music missing from PVC → Re-run infra deploy to trigger `sync_music` job (syncs from R2). For manual recovery: `aws s3 sync s3://$MUSIC_BUCKET/ ./music/ --endpoint-url $S3_ENDPOINT` then `kubectl cp` each genre dir individually into the pod.
9. Repeated Postgres `role "root" does not exist` lines in GitHub Actions are often service-log noise, not the failure. They’re misleading because Actions prints service container logs after a job fails. Generally check for other errors before stopping to try and fix this probable red-herring.

### Keybinding change checklist

When modifying any keybinding, update **all** of the following:

1. **Input handler** — the actual `match byte` in the relevant `input.rs` (screen-specific or `app/input.rs` for globals)
2. **Help modal** — `app/help_modal/data.rs` (slide copy, e.g. Overview "This modal" section) and `app/help_modal/ui.rs` `draw_footer()` keybind line
3. **Settings modal** — `app/settings_modal/ui.rs` `draw_footer()` keybind line and the bordered help callout in `draw_help_callout()`
4. **Sidebar hints** — `app/common/sidebar.rs`, e.g. the volume/mute hint line in Now Playing
5. **Game guard** — `app/input.rs` `handle_global_key()`, where active games suppress global byte shortcuts before screen-specific game routing
6. **This table** — the keyboard shortcuts table above in CONTEXT.md
7. **Game info panels** — per-game UI panels that show controls (check each game's `ui.rs`)
