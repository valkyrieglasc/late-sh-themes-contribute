How music works on late.sh

SSH is a terminal protocol - it carries text, not audio. To hear music you need a second audio channel that pairs with your SSH session.

Option 1 (recommended): Install the CLI

  curl -fsSL https://cli.late.sh/install.sh | bash

Then run `late` instead of `ssh late.sh`. It launches SSH + local audio playback in one process - no browser needed. The CLI decodes the MP3 stream locally, plays through your system audio, and pairs with the TUI over WebSocket for visualizer + controls.

Don't trust the install script? Build from source:

  git clone https://github.com/mpiorowski/late-sh
  cargo install --path late-cli

Option 2: Browser pairing

Press `P` to open a QR code + copy the pairing URL. The browser connects to your session via a token-based WebSocket, streams audio, and feeds visualizer frames back to the sidebar.

Both options give you:
  m = mute | +/- = volume | visualizer in the sidebar
  Vote for genres on the Dashboard: L C A

The stream is 128kbps MP3 from Icecast, fed by Liquidsoap playlists of CC0/CC-BY music. The winning genre switches every hour based on votes.";
